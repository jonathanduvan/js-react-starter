I created two component files all encapsulated in the app.js file in order to implement a note writing app. The application utilizes the Reactjavascript library along with SASS. A user is able to create a note with a title, write and edit content, drag it, and delete it.

I had issues with my zindex solution for allowing clicked notes to move to the front. I also had issues with having the markdown resize with the note. I did implement for extra credit a nice note color, and resize using react's resizable and moveable component.
